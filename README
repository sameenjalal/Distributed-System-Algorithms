Stadium Count Problem
Distributed Systems: Assignment 4

Before Running Our Program:
	Change the directory that the "dir" variable points to in the "pcounter" file.
	Then put the "pcounter" file in the home directory
	Then "cd" into the directory that contains the Makefile
	Run "make"

To Run Our Program Manually:
	"make server" - to run a specific instance of the program
	"make start" - to trigger the stadium count problem after a set number of nodes have entered the network

To Run Our Program with a Script:
	./start_pcounter.sh

Running our program will output files that end in ".out" in the home directory.
	To check run: "cat *.out"
